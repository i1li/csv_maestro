## Description
The `midicsv` and `csvmidi` programs permit you to intertranslate standard MIDI files and CSV files. These CSV files preserve all information in the MIDI file, and may be loaded into spreadsheet and database programs or easily manipulated with text processing tools. This document describes the CSV representation of MIDI files written by `midicsv` and read by `csvmidi`. Readers are assumed to understand the structure, terminology and contents of MIDI files. Please refer to a MIDI file reference for details.

## Record Structure
Each record in the CSV **representation** of a MIDI contains at least three fields:

* `Track`: Numeric field identifying the track to which this record belongs. Tracks of MIDI data are numbered starting at 1. Track 0 is reserved for file header, information, and end of file records.
* `Time`: Absolute time, in terms of MIDI clocks(ticks), at which this event occurs. Automatically rounded to nearest whole number. Meta-events for which time is not meaningful (for example, song title, copyright information, etc.) have an absolute time of 0.
* `Type`: Name identifying the type of the record. Record types are text consisting of case-insensitive letters and the underscore (`_`), contain no spaces, and are not enclosed in quotes. Since `csvmidi` ignores casing in the Type field, `Note_on_c`, `Note_On_C`, and `NOTE_ON_C` are considered identical.

Records in the CSV file are sorted first by the track number, then by time. Out of order records will be discarded with an error message from `csvmidi`. Following the three required fields are parameter fields which depend upon the Type. Some Types take no parameters. Each Type and its parameter fields is discussed below.

Any line with an initial nonblank character of `#` or `;` is ignored. Either delimiter may be used to introduce comments in a CSV file. Only full-line comments are permitted. You cannot use these delimiters to terminate scanning of a regular data record. Completely blank lines are ignored.

### File Structure Records
`0, 0, Header, format, nTracks, division`
The first record of a CSV MIDI file is always the Header record.
* `format`: the MIDI file type (0, 1, or 2)
* `nTracks`: the number of tracks in the file
* `division`: (default value 480) the number of clock pulses per quarter note(PPQ). Max value is 30,000, but the standard value of 480 is fine for most uses. The first 2 values (Track and Time) are always zero here.

`Track, 0, Start_track`
A Start_track record marks the start of a new track, with the Track field giving the track number. All records between the Start_track record and the matching End_track will have the same Track field.

`Track, Time, End_track`
An End_track marks the end of events for the specified Track. The Time field gives the total duration of the track, which will be identical to the Time in the last event before the End_track.

### File Meta-Events
The following events occur within MIDI tracks and specify various kinds of information and actions. They may appear at any time within the track. Those which provide general information for which time is not relevant usually appear at the start of the track with Time zero, but this is not a requirement.

Many of these meta-events include a text string argument. Text strings are output in CSV records enclosed in ASCII double quote (`"`) characters. Quote characters embedded within strings are represented by two consecutive quotes. Non-graphic characters in the ISO 8859-1 Latin-1 set are output as a backslash followed by their three digit octal character code. Two consecutive backslashes denote a literal backslash in the string. Strings in MIDI files can be extremely long, theoretically as many as 228−1 characters. Programs which process MIDI CSV files should take care to avoid buffer overflows or truncation resulting from lines containing long string items. All meta-events which take a text argument are identified by a suffix of `_t`.

`Track, Time, Title_t, Text`
The Text specifies the title of the track or sequence. The first Title meta-event in a type 0 MIDI file, or in the first track of a type 1 file gives the name of the work. Subsequent Title meta-events in other tracks give the names of those tracks.

`Track, Time, Copyright_t, Text`
The Text specifies copyright information for the sequence. This is usually placed at time 0 of the first track in the sequence.

`Track, Time, Instrument_name_t, Text`
The Text names the instrument intended to play the contents of this track, This is usually placed at time 0 of the track. Note that this meta-event is simply a description. MIDI synthesizers are not required (and rarely if ever) respond to it. This meta-event is particularly useful in sequences prepared for synthesizers which do not conform to the General MIDI patch set, as it documents the intended instrument for the track when the sequence is used on a synthesizer with a different patch set.

`Track, Time, Marker_t, Text`
The Text marks a point in the sequence which occurs at the given Time, for example "Third Movement".

`Track, Time, Cue_point_t, Text`
The Text identifies synchronization point which occurs at the specified Time, for example, "Door slams".

`Track, Time, Lyric_t, Text`
The Text gives a lyric intended to be sung at the given Time. Lyrics are often broken down into separate syllables to time-align them more precisely with the sequence.

`Track, Time, Text_t, Text`
This meta-event supplies an arbitrary Text string tagged to the Track and Time. It can be used for textual information which doesn't fall into one of the more specific categories given above.

`Track, 0, Sequence_number, Number`
This meta-event specifies a sequence Number between 0 and 65535, used to arrange multiple tracks in a type 2 MIDI file, or to identify the sequence in which a collection of type 0 or 1 MIDI files should be played. The Sequence_number meta-event should occur at Time zero, at the start of the track.

`Track, Time, MIDI_port, Number`
This meta-event specifies that subsequent events in the Track should be sent to MIDI port (bus) Number, between 0 and 255. This meta-event usually appears at the start of a track with Time zero, but may appear within a track should the need arise to change the port while the track is being played.

`Track, Time, Channel_prefix, Number`
This meta-event specifies the MIDI channel that subsequent meta-events and System_exclusive events pertain to. The channel Number specifies a MIDI channel from 0 to 15. In fact, the Number may be as large as 255, but the consequences of specifying a channel number greater than 15 are undefined.

`Track, Time, Time_signature, Num, Denom, Click, NotesQ`
Time_signature, Meter, or Metre are valid identifiers, depending on your preference. Num and Denom are the numerator and denominator of the time signature as specified on sheet music. Click and NotesQ can be left empty for default values. Click is the number of MIDI clocks per metronome click (default value is 24). NotesQ is the number of 32nd notes in a quarter note (default value is 8).

`Track, Time, Key_signature, Key, Major/Minor`
The key signature is specified by the numeric Key value, which is 0 for the key of C, a positive value for each sharp above C, or a negative value for each flat below C, thus in the inclusive range −7 to 7. The Major/Minor field is a quoted string which will be major for a major key and minor for a minor key.

`Track, Time, Tempo, Number`
The tempo is specified as the Number of beats per minute (BPM). Tempo or BPM are both valid identifiers, depending on your preference.

`Track, 0, SMPTE_offset, Hour, Minute, Second, Frame, FracFrame`
This meta-event, which must occur with a zero Time at the start of a track, specifies the SMPTE time code at which it should start playing. The FracFrame field gives the fractional frame time (0 to 99).

`Track, Time, Sequencer_specific, Length, Data, …`
The Sequencer_specific meta-event is used to store vendor-proprietary data in a MIDI file. The Length can be any value between 0 and 228−1, specifying the number of Data bytes (between 0 and 255) which follow. Sequencer_specific records may be very long. programs which process MIDI CSV files should be careful to protect against buffer overflows and truncation of these records.

`Track, Time, Unknown_meta_event, Type, Length, Data, …`
If `midicsv` encounters a meta-event with a code not defined by the standard MIDI file specification, it outputs an unknown meta-event record in which Type gives the numeric meta-event type code, Length the number of data bytes in the meta-event, which can be any value between 0 and 228−1, followed by the Data bytes. Since meta-events include their own length, it is possible to parse them even if their type and meaning are unknown. `csvmidi` will reconstruct unknown meta-events with the same type code and content as in the original MIDI file.

### Channel Events
These events are the “meat and potatoes” of MIDI files: the actual notes and modifiers that command the instruments to play the music. Each has a MIDI channel number as its first argument, followed by event-specific parameters. To permit programs which process CSV files to easily distinguish them from meta-events, names of channel events all have a suffix of “_c”.

`Track, Time, Note_on_c, Channel, Note, Velocity`
Send a command to play the specified Note (Middle C is defined as Note number 60. All other notes are relative in the MIDI specification, but most instruments conform to the well-tempered scale) on the given Channel with Velocity (0 to 127). Velocity is automatically rounded to nearest whole number. A Note_on_c event with Velocity zero is equivalent to a Note_off_c.

`Track, Time, Note_off_c, Channel, Note`
Stop playing the specified Note on the given Channel. No velocity needed here.

`Track, Time, Pitch_bend_c, Channel, Value`
Send a pitch bend command of the specified Value to the given Channel. The pitch bend Value is a 14 bit unsigned integer and hence must be in the inclusive range from 0 to 16383. The value 8192 indicates no pitch bend. 0 the lowest pitch bend, and 16383 the highest. The actual change in pitch these values produce is typically 2 semitones up or down by MIDI default, although this may vary for some controllers, with some offering the option to set a custom range.

`Track, Time, Control_c, Channel, Control_num, Value`
Set the controller Control_num on the given Channel to the specified Value. Control_num and Value must be in the inclusive range 0 to 127. The assignment of Control_num values to effects differs from instrument to instrument. The General MIDI specification defines the meaning of controllers 1 (modulation), 7 (volume), 10 (pan), 11 (expression), and 64 (sustain), but not all instruments and patches respond to these controllers. Instruments which support those capabilities usually assign reverberation to controller 91 and chorus to controller 93.

`Track, Time, Program_c, Channel, Program_num`
Switch the specified Channel to program (patch) Program_num, which must be between 0 and 127. The program or patch selects which instrument and associated settings that channel will emulate. The General MIDI specification provides a standard set of instruments, but synthesizers are free to implement other sets of instruments and many permit the user to create custom patches and assign them to program numbers.

Apparently, due to instrument manufacturers' skepticism about musicians' ability to cope with the number zero, many instruments number patches from 1 to 128 rather than the 0 to 127 used within MIDI files. When interpreting Program_num values, note that they may be one less than the patch numbers given in an instrument's documentation.

`Track, Time, Channel_aftertouch_c, Channel, Value`
When a key is held down after being pressed, some synthesizers send the pressure, repeatedly if it varies, until the key is released, but do not distinguish pressure on different keys played simultaneously and held down. This is referred to as `monophonic` or `channel` aftertouch (the latter indicating it applies to the Channel as a whole, not individual note numbers on that channel). The pressure Value (0 to 127) is typically taken to apply to the last note played, but instruments are not guaranteed to behave in this manner.

`Track, Time, Poly_aftertouch_c, Channel, Note, Value`
Polyphonic synthesizers (those capable of playing multiple notes simultaneously on a single channel), often provide independent aftertouch for each note. This event specifies the aftertouch pressure Value (0 to 127) for the specified Note on the given Channel.

### System Exclusive Events
System Exclusive events permit storing vendor-specific information to be transmitted to that vendor's products.

`Track, Time, System_exclusive, Length, Data, …`
The Length bytes of Data (0 to 255) are sent at the specified Time to the MIDI channel defined by the most recent Channel_prefix event on the Track, as a System Exclusive message. Note that Length can be any value between 0 and 228−1. Programs which process MIDI CSV files should be careful to protect against buffer overflows and truncation of these records.

`Track, Time, System_exclusive_packet, Length, Data, …`
The Length bytes of Data (0 to 255) are sent at the specified Time to the MIDI channel defined by the most recent Channel_prefix event on the Track. The Data bytes are simply blasted out to the MIDI bus without any prefix. This message is used by MIDI devices which break up long system exclusive message into small packets, spaced out in time to avoid overdriving their modest microcontrollers. Note that Length can be any value between 0 and 228−1. Programs which process MIDI CSV files should be careful to protect against buffer overflows and truncation of these records.

## Examples
The following CSV file defines the five-note motif from the film Close Encounters of the Third Kind using an organ patch from the General MIDI instrument set. When processed by `midicsv` and sent to a synthesizer which conforms to General MIDI, the sequence will be played.
